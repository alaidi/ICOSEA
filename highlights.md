* Bringing to light a very hot topic: Recent natural disasters, such as the 2008 Midwest floods and Katrina and Sandy Hurricanes in    the United States, the earthquakes in Sichuan, China, the Canterbury earthquakes in New Zealand, and a host of other 
  modern natural disasters have all highlighted the vulnerability of even modern infrastructure to natural hazards.
* Promoting a Game shift: Protecting infrastructure from extreme events calls for an integrated approach to hazard 
  assessment considering the correlated nature of natural hazards, cascading hazards and cascading effects.
* In a world of increasingly interdisciplinary research this conference aims to bring together specialists 
  from different scientific fields in order to promote “out of the box” thinking and cross-fertilization.

The aim of sustainable design is to produce places, products and services in a way that reduces use of non-renewable resources, minimizes environmental impact, and relates people with the natural environment.
